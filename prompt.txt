The fn argument is very flexible -- you can pass any Python function that you want to wrap with a UI. In the example above, we saw a relatively simple function, but the function could be anything from a music generator to a tax calculator to the prediction function of a pretrained machine learning model.

The inputs and outputs arguments take one or more Gradio components. As we'll see, Gradio includes more than 30 built-in components (such as the gr.Textbox(), gr.Image(), and gr.HTML() components) that are designed for machine learning applications.
